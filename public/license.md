- "Access Key": A secure token that authenticates your access to Proprietary Features.

### 2. Grant of License

#### a) Preview Package Usage
You may:
- Download and use the Preview Package for free during the preview period.
- Integrate it into your development tools and build processes.
- Use publicly available commands (e.g., "xcss preview").
The preview period begins on the Effective Date and ends on April 3, 2025 (or a date we specify).
Attempts to circumvent the preview period restrictions are a violation of this License.

#### b) Proprietary Features
- Additional features (e.g., advanced builds, API access) require a paid license.
- Licenses are granted per organization or individual and are non-transferable.
- Proprietary Features may not be shared or redistributed.
- Usage of Proprietary Features requires a valid Project ID, Access Key, and sufficient Credits.

### 3. Usage Authorization and Credits

- Authentication: To get optimized output using "xcss build", you must provide a valid Project ID and Access Key.
- Credits: Each use of a build command consumes Credits (e.g., $2 per Credit or bundled rates, see xcss.xpktr.com for pricing documentation).
- Credit Management: You are responsible for maintaining a sufficient credit balance. If your balance reaches zero, access to the build command will be replaced by the preview command, which is not recommended for production purposes.
- Compliance: Any attempt to bypass the credit system or use Proprietary Features without proper authorization is a violation of this License.
